Project: Book Club

Group Member Names: Matt Weiss, Michael Karnes

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?): Become more comfortable with the vocab, and get better at explaining it a high level, as well as understanding the innerworkings of the applications. We both want to improve on our testing and write tests before each piece of functionality.

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here): We are both executors, so communication and waffle will be key so neither of us get too far ahead.

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles: We are both methodical so as long as we communicate we should be able to work through most problems.  

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?): We plan working together in person as much as possible, during work time, as well as after classes. Also we will be available in person until 7pm, unless we both agree to call it a day.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?): During school hours we will reply to slack messages within 2 hrs, and outside of school hours within 12.

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement): We both want to be able to explain vocab/our process at a high level. We both also want to improve on our testing and learn as much as possible.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?): Rather than deciding now, we will work together on slack to split the work via waffle.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques): We will commit after every functioning alteration or addition to our code (we plan on going overboard on commits to create better workflow habits). We will also make an effort to comment on each others PR's, as well as only merging when we are together.  

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback: We both are very comfortable with every type of feedback.

Project management tools we will use: Waffle.io
